            <h2>About</h2>
            <p>
                Phone Tree Manager is an open source application designed to simplify and streamline the process of managing phone calls in a professional setting. 
                Inspired by my personal experience working as a cashier in retail, where handling numerous phone calls daily became increasingly stressful and overwhelming, 
                this app aims to provide a more organized and efficient way to manage communication.

            <h2>Inspiration</h2>
            <p>
                During my time in retail, I found myself juggling a high volume of calls, leading to significant stress. The traditional methods of tracking these calls 
                proved inadequate. As an aviation enthusiast, I was familiar with the concept of air traffic control strips used to manage aircraft movements. 
                This inspired me to envision a similar approach for phone call managementâ€”a structured, visual method to track calls as they move through various stages.

            <h2>The Solution</h2>
            <p>
                Initially, I experimented with a physical "air traffic control strips" system to manage calls, but it quickly became messy. I decided to leverage my 
                programming skills to create Phone Tree Manager, which provides a clear, visual representation of the status of each call right from my mobile phone. This includes whether it is inbound, 
                on hold, or parked for another team member, along with the relevant store identification number and extension information.

        <div class="section">
            <h2>Open Source</h2>
            <p>
                Phone Tree Manager is open source to encourage community-driven solutions and collaboration. By sharing the source code, free of charge, I aim to empower individuals and 
                organizations to customize and adapt the tool to their specific needs. Contributions from developers worldwide will lead to continuous improvement and innovation.
